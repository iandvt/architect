# Development

This document covers local setup, build/test commands, and release steps.

## Prerequisites

- Nix with flakes enabled
- macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools if you plan to use Homebrew dependencies

## Setup

1. (Optional) Pre-fetch the ghostty dependency to speed up the first build:
   ```bash
   just setup
   ```
   `just setup` caches the `ghostty` source tarball; the regular build will fetch it automatically if you skip this step.

2. Enter the development shell:
   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

   Or, if using direnv:
   ```bash
   direnv allow
   ```

   On macOS hosts where the active `MacOSX.sdk` only exposes `arm64e` targets, Zig 0.15.2 can fail during native Darwin linking with errors such as `undefined symbol: __availability_version_check`. The upstream tracker for this regression is https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/31756.

   The dev shell works around that by exposing `MacOSX15.4.sdk` through a fake `DEVELOPER_DIR` and a narrow `xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path` shim. `build.zig` also resolves framework paths through `DEVELOPER_DIR` and `xcrun` before it falls back to hardcoded SDK locations, so the workaround does not need to force `SDKROOT`.

   Remove this workaround once Architect no longer uses Zig 0.15.2, or once Zig handles the arm64e-only macOS SDK stubs correctly. If the active `MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib/libSystem.tbd` advertises `arm64-macos` again, the shell hook becomes a no-op.

3. Verify the environment:
   ```bash
   zig version  # Should show 0.15.2+ (compatible with ghostty-vt)
   just --list  # Show available commands
   ```

## Build and Run

Build the project:
```bash
just build
# or
zig build
```

Build optimized release:
```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

Run the application:
```bash
just run
# or
zig build run
```

## Dependencies and Tooling

- **ghostty-vt** is fetched as a pinned tarball via the Zig package manager (`build.zig.zon`).
- **SDL3** and **SDL3_ttf** are provided by Nix. SDL3 is pinned to 3.4.0 via `overlays/sdl3-3-4-0.nix` with binaries cached in the public `forketyfork` Cachix to avoid rebuilds.

## Tests and Formatting

Run tests:
```bash
just test
# or
zig build test
```

Check formatting and script linting:
```bash
just lint
# or
zig fmt --check src/
shellcheck scripts/*.sh scripts/verify-setup.sh
ruff check scripts/*.py
```

Format code:
```bash
zig fmt src/
```

## Release Process

macOS release binaries are automatically built for both ARM64 (Apple Silicon) and x86_64 (Intel) architectures via GitHub Actions when a version tag is pushed:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The release workflow packages ad-hoc-signed app bundles with local `codesign --sign -`. It does not import macOS signing certificates, does not produce Developer ID-signed artifacts, and does not notarize the app. Release downloads therefore still require clearing the quarantine attribute after extraction, as described in the README installation instructions. You can also run the Release workflow manually with `workflow_dispatch` to validate the packaging flow before pushing a real release tag.

Each release includes:
- `architect-macos-arm64.tar.gz` - Apple Silicon
- `architect-macos-x86_64.tar.gz` - Intel
